Traffic Control Simulator is an open-source tool for simulating city traffic control, to get the optimal setup, to reduce waiting time for everyone, either car drivers or pedestrians.

# About
## 2022 UniHack ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´

This project was originally ideated and written in the [UniHack](https://unihack.eu/) Hackathon, hosted in TimiÈ™oara, Romania, from the 24th to the 27th of November. 

## Track

We chose to develop over the **Smart City**, trying to find the best eco-friendly solution that we could achieve in a short ammount of time.

The first problem we found is that, since we're not from TimiÈ™oara, nor from anywhere near, seeing the problems in a city, or how it could be improved becomes sort of a challenge. 

That's how we came up with this project idea: **Traffic Control Simulator**.

## Idea

The main point of this is to create an open-source Simulation Tool, based on cities, to be able to represent traffic situations, and how this could be solved.

## Project

We used mainly **C++** to develop the software, since it's a programming language we're pretty familiar with.

Although it's a challenge to write a full Desktop Application in 48 hours using C++ as our language, we were confident in that we could take it on, and have at least a smal MVP for the project showcase, as a prove of concept.

## Aburrits.dev

This entire project was developed by us, comming from Barcelona, under the name of **Aburrits.dev**. 

This are the names of all 4 of the developers:

- Joaquim Torra Garcia
- Pau Gibert Moreno
- Angel Prat VilÃ 
- Jorge BorrÃ¡s i Duarte
